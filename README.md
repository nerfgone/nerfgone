>> Sunset Rollercoaster is a 5-piece jazz-influenced synth-pop band from Taipei, Taiwan consisting of Kuo-Hung Tseng (vocals, guitar), Hung-Li Chen (bass), Shao-Hsuan Wang (keyboard), Tsun-Lung Lo (drums), Hao-Ting Huang (saxophone), and former member Shih-Wei Huang (percussion). The name originated from a Photo Booth picture the group had taken for their MySpace profile in the 2009, which had a rollercoaster in front of a sunset as the background. The band mostly sings in English, despite being based in a Mandarin-speaking country, which, according to lead singer Kuo Kuo, is to allow them to speak indirectly and allow audiences to discern their own meaning.
## 2. Monsune

>>Trop-pop duo Summer Salt – singer/guitarist Matthew Terry and drummer Eugene Chung – spent many years building towards their latest album, Sequoia Moon (2021), ever since jettisoning their Dallas, Texas, hometown for the arts-and-culture oasis of Austin after graduating high school in the early 2010s. The band quickly rose through the ranks of the local Austin scene with their 2014 debut Driving To Hawaii, teeming with both the escapism and recklessness of youth and the composure and charm of ‘60s-era pop, doo wop and bossa nova.
## 4. Tame Impala
